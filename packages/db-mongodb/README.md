# Payload MongoDB Adapter

This is an unnoficial MongoDB adapter for Payload. It is not yet ready for production use.  It is currently being developed
to support `readPrefence=nearest` for local reads, which is incompatible with the official MongoDB adapter that required `readPreference=primary` to support transactions.
